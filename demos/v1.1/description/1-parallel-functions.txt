For v1.1 Karel we have added more functionality, now Karel is able to share beepers with all his descendants (and viceversa) using the <code>givebeeper(number)</code> function. <br>
Also, there are new conditionals available in the world of Karel:
<pre>
<code>
nextToSon
notNextToSon
nextToFather
notNextToFather
nextToDescendant
notNextToDescendant
</code>
</pre>
